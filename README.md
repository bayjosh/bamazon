##Bamazon App

###Description 
This app is an command-line Amazon-like store that allows users to take on the role of customers or managers to buy or interact with product inventory. 

###How it Works:

As a customer, a user can purchase one of a number of products that alters the database connected to our app. As a manager, a user can view inventory, view low stock items, add to inventory or add new products, all of which also interact with our connected Bamazon database.
